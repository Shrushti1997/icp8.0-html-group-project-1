    <h1>Top Historical Forts In India That You Must Visit :</h1>
    <p><h2>Most of the forts in India are castles, fortified palaces or fortresses, but when the British government in India cataloged the 17th-19th-century defenses, they used the word forts that became the common description across India. Local names of forts of India are suffixed by local word for fort, so it is common to use the Sanskrit word Durga, or Hindi word qila, or the Rajasthan, Assam, and Maharashtra word Garh or gad. </p></h2>
    <p>A fort around which a township grew and developed was the capital of each Raja or chieftain; this pattern can be seen in many South Asian cities like Delhi, Agra, Rajasthan, Lahore, Pune, Kolkata, Surat, and Mumbai.</p>
